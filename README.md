  - Calculate Number of Inversion (Merge Sort)
    >
    >Input data: 100,000 integers between 1 and 100,000(inclusive) in some order, with no integer repeated
    >
    >To compute the number of inversion in the file given, where the i<sup>th</sup> row of the file indicates the i<sup>th</sup> entry of an array
    >
  - Compare three different pivot rules
    >
    >Input date: 10,000 integers between 1 and 10,000(inclusive) in unsorted order, with no repeats. The integer in the i<sup>th</sup> row of the file gives you the i<sup>th</sup> entry of an input array.
    >
    >To compute and compare the total number of comparisons used to sort the given input file by QuickSort with different pivot rules.
    > - Pivot rule 1 : First Element
    > - Pivot rule 2 : Final Element
    > - Pivot rule 3 : Median-Of-Three
    >
